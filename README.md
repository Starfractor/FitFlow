# About
**FitFlow** is a mobile application that seeks to address the challenges students face with their physical health.

Since students have busy schedules, they can forget to incorporate healthy habits in their daily lives. We want to provide an app to help students keep track of their health, remind them of drinking/eating healthy, and receive recommendations for their lifestyle choices.
